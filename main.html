	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures the how much time requires to solve the problem.If the time reqired to solve the problem is minimum then we say that it is an efficient algorithm.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>Space Complexity refers to the space required to solve the given problem.For eg., O(n))</p>
